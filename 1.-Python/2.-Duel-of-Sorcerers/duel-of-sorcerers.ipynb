Each sorcerer has 10 spells of variable power in their mind and they are going to throw them one after the other. The winner of the duel will be the one who wins more of those clashes between spells. Spells are represented as a list of 10 integers whose value equals the power of the spell.\n",

    "```\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- The first clash is won by Saruman: 10 against 23.\n",
    "- The second clash is won by Saruman: 11 against 66.\n",
    "- ...\n",
